# Rive Animation Placeholder Files

These files are placeholders for actual Rive animations that would be created in the Rive app.

## Files needed:
- hero-animation.riv - For the main hero image animation
- latency-animation.riv - For the latency chart animation  
- country-animation.riv - For the country map animation
- icon-animation.riv - For the icon animations

## How to create these in Rive:

1. Open Rive app (rive.app)
2. Create a new project
3. Import your PNG images
4. Create animations with:
   - Fade in/out effects
   - Scale animations
   - Rotation effects
   - Position animations
5. Export as .riv files
6. Place them in this directory

## Animation Ideas:

### Hero Animation (main1.png):
- Fade in from 0 to 1 opacity
- Scale from 0.8 to 1.0
- Subtle floating motion

### Latency Animation (latency.png):
- Progressive reveal of chart elements
- Pulse effect on data points
- Animated lines drawing in

### Country Animation (country.png):
- Zoom in effect
- Highlight different regions
- Pulsing dots for locations

### Icon Animation (icon.png):
- Rotate on hover
- Scale bounce effect
- Glow effect

For now, the components will fall back to the static PNG images with CSS animations.
